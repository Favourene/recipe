		<h2>Nigerian Coconut Rice</h2>
		<img src="Coconot.jpg">
		<h3>List of Ingridents</h3>
		<ul>
				<li>3 cigar cups | 750g long grain parboiled rice</li>
				<li>500mls Tomato Stew</li>
				<li>600 mls Coconut Milk</li>
				<li>Chicken (whole chicken or drumsticks)</li>
				<li>Chilli pepper (to taste)</li>
				<li>Salt (to taste)</li>
				<li>1 medium onions</li>
				<li>3 stock cubes</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon thyme</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Method of Preparation</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare the tomato stew if you don't have some in the freezer. Visit the Tomato Stew page for details on how to do that. It is advisable to prepare tomato stew before hand and keep in the freezer. This is so that whenever you want to cook any jollof rice related dish, it is just a matter of adding it to your cooking.</li>
			<li>If you will use whole chicken, wash and cut the whole chicken into pieces. Place the pieces in a pot; add water till it just covers the pieces of chicken, add the chopped onions, stock cubes and thyme and start cooking. The cooking time depends on the type of chicken. The rooster or cockerel cooks much faster than the hen but the hen is tastier.<br>Cooking till done and add salt to taste. Put the pieces of chicken in a sieve to drain, then fry with vegetable oil. You can also grill it in an oven. This is to give it a golden look which is more presentable especially if you have guests for dinner</li>
			<li>Now is the time to extract the coconut milk<br> Set the coconut milk aside</li>
			<li>Parboil the rice<br> Wash the parboiled rice and put in a sieve to drain.</li>
			<li>Now we need a pot big enough to accommodate the rice till it is done. Bear in mind that the rice will normally rise by at least one quarter of its quantity from the parboiled state to the done state.</li>
			<li>Pour the chicken stock, coconut milk and the tomato stew into the selected pot. Set on the stove to boil. Add the drained parboiled rice, salt and pepper to taste. If necessary, top up with water to bring the water level to the same level as the rice. This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked.</li>
			<li>Cover the pot and leave to cook on medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up.</li>

		<h2>Chicken Fried Rice</h2>
		<img src="chicken.jpg">
		<h3>List of Ingridents</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil</li>
			<li>3/4 to 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups frozen peas and diced carrots blend (I don’t thaw and use straight from the freezer)</li>
			<li>3 green onions, trimmed and sliced into thin rounds</li>
			<li>2 to 3 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
			<li>4 cups cooked rice (I use white, long-grain or brown may be substituted. To save time use two 8.8-ounce pouches cooked and ready-to-serve rice)</li>
			<li>3 to 4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
			<li>salt and pepper, optional and to taste</li>
			<li>2 rosemary sprigs</li>
		</ul>
			<h3>Method of Preparation</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>To a large non-stick skillet or wok, add the oils, chicken, and cook over medium-high heat for about 3 to 5 minutes, flipping intermittently so all sides cook evenly. Cooking time will vary based on thickness of chicken breasts and sizes of pieces. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon (allow oils and cooking juices from chicken to remain in skillet) and place chicken on a plate; set aside.</li>
				<li>Add the peas, carrots, green onions, and cook for about 2 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften, stir intermittently.</li>
				<li>Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, stir intermittently.</li>
				<li>Push vegetables to one side of the skillet, add the eggs to the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary.</li>
				<li>Add the chicken, rice, evenly drizzle with soy sauce, optional salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until chicken is reheated through. Recipe is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Reheat gently as desired.</li>
